## Description

When my Boss said he was going to fire me, this is **not** what I had in mind! 😱💥

In Cannonball Courier 💥 we improve productivity 📈 by literally shooting you out of a cannon 🚀. Who needs a truck 🚛 or a scooter 🛵, we use gunpowder instead!

Make sure to bring packages 📦 to every household that needs them, _but be careful_, we only pay for properly delivered goods! 💸

Want to be even more productive 💪🏽 (and unlock some secret outfits 👀), buy the upgrades to go faster 🦔, higher 🛫  and carry more packages 🏋🏽. All in the name of capitalism 💰. How fun! ~we will deduct the expenses for the upgrades from your paycheck~.

### Controls
Use your mouse for the menu's.
Use your mouse or the spacebar for firing and delivering packages.
